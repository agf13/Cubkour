# Cubkour

run the game:
  in the folder "TheGameItself", the file "finalVersion.exe"
  
about the game:
  you are a cube that can move and jump. The cube points to the cursor. Hitting a wall will reset the force pulling you down, allowing you to gain altitude. 
  Holding space down, will make the cube jump by applying an upward force. In other words, when space is hold, the player falls slower.
  Double tap on the "w" key to increase your speed. 
  
easter egg hint:
  You can see cubvin's toughts whenever you want, as long as he tought them once.
